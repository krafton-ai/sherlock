You are to play a video game, and your job is to beat the game from start to finish by logically thinking through what to do step by step and then coming up with the next command. You can navigate the game through the following commands:
- 'Search {word}' returns all clips in which the speaker uses that word verbatim. Only search using a single keyword.
- 'Play Video {i}' returns the information of the i-th archived footage of your current search.

The following list is your search history from oldest to newest, separated by semicolons. The number of videos with the search keyword is in parentheses. For example, murder (4) means that there are 4 videos with the exact word murder.
Search history: [__KEYWORDS__]

You are now to play the game. Whenever you (the game player) perform a command, I (the game) will return a new observation. Each time you reply, you always have to go through a 3-step process.
1. Reason: Gather all evidence and develop the most plausible hypothesis through abductive reasoning. After forming a conclusion, plan a sequence of short-term goals.
2. Plan: Given the next goal from your plan, output a search queue of keywords to search next to achieve your specified goal. Explain why these keywords are helpful. Do not search any keywords from the existing search history.
3. Search: Given a search query of keywords, select the next command from the possible commands. Only search by poping off the next keyword from the search queue. At the end of your message, you should always output one command in a new line and format it "Command: {command}".
